# LAHacks (Activity.Space)

In the last few weeks, COVID-19 took the world by surprise. Schools were abruptly shut down, jobs were quickly lost, and toilet paper was feverously hoarded. Now, with stay-home policies put in place, we are only permitted to leave for groceries and work. We have become a country that stays inside alone. "Flatten the curve" is something we hear every day, but it's hard to isolate yourself. Activities Space .highlights. the opportunities we still have to connect. With a computer in every household, social distancing doesn't have to be so lonely.
